abstract = {This work, which has become a classic in music theory since its publication in 1983, models music understanding from the perspective of cognitive science. The point of departure is a search for a grammar of music with the aid of generative linguistics. The theory, which is illustrated with numerous examples from Western classical music, relates the aural surface of a piece to the musical structure unconsciously inferred by the experienced listener. From the viewpoint of traditional music theory, it offers many innovations in notation as well as in the substance of rhythmic and reductional theory.},

@book{Brent2013,
abstract = {This outstanding text for graduate students and researchers proposes improvements to existing algorithms, extends their related mathematical theories, and offers details on new algorithms for approximating local and global minima. None of the algorithms requires an evaluation of derivatives; all depend entirely on sequential function evaluation, a highly practical scenario in the frequent event of difficult-to-evaluate derivatives.Topics include the use of successive interpolation for finding simple zeros of a function and its derivatives; an algorithm with guaranteed convergence for finding a minimum of a function of one variation; global minimization given an upper bound on the second derivative; and a new algorithm for minimizing a function of several variables without calculating derivatives. Many numerical examples augment the text, along with a complete analysis of rate of convergence for most algorithms and error bounds that allow for the effect of rounding errors.},

@article{Widmer2009,
abstract = {The article is about AI research in the context of a complex artistic behavior: expressive music performance. A computer program is presented that learns to play piano with 'expression' and that even won an international computer piano performance contest. A superficial analysis of an expressive performance generated by the system seems to suggest creative musical abilities. After a critical discussion of the processes underlying this behavior, we abandon the question of whether the system is really creative, and turn to the true motivation that drives this research: to use AI methods to investigate and better understand music performance as a human creative behavior. A number of recent and current results from our research are briefly presented that indicate that machines can give us interesting insights into such a complex creative behavior, even if they may not be creative themselves.},
