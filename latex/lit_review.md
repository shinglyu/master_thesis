Hard to compare
   * Only RenCon is available
   * Lack of universal corpus
   * Different goals: reproduce human, creative, emotion
   * Different level of automation/human intervention

Rule based:
   Pros:
      *  Large room for creativity, because there are a lot of parameters to tune
   Cons
      * Rule comes with exceptions
      * Can only capture rough ideas, not nuances
      * Expert interveiw can only get rules that experts are  mindfully aware of

Linear Regression
    Pros
       * Simple, quick
    Cons
       * assume linear is oversimplification

Artificial Neural Network
   Pros
      * Can capture nuance
      * Better than pure-rule
      * Can learn emotion, expression, etc
   Cons
      * Long training
      * Corpus is hard to get

Case and instance-based
   * Fuzzy logic: SaxEx
   Pros

Other features:
   * Emotion space
   * Instrument model

In-out
   Train
      In: human analysis or example(score+MIDI or score+audio)
      Out: model or rule
    Gen
       In: score or non-expressive audio
       Out expressive audio

* Musicological analysis is too demanding for trainer and there exists differnent schools
