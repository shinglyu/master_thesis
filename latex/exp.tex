\chapter{Experiments, Results and Discussions}
\label{chap:exp}
In this chapter, we will show some experiment results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Section \ref{sec:onsetnormexp} deals with the onset deviation problem highlighted in Section \ref{sec:normalize}. Section \ref{sec:paramselect} discusses how the various parameters in our system are chosen. Section \ref{sec:turing} describes a subjective test to see if audience can or cannot identify the difference between generated and human performances.


\section{Onset Deviation Normalization}
\label{sec:onsetnormexp}
\framebox{TODO:onset deviation problem review}
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:normalize}, a bad normalization method will usually result in unreasonable high onset deviation. To overcome this challenge, we proposed a automatic way to select the normalization parameter. In this section, we will evaluate the effectiveness of the method. 

We extract the onset deviation feature from performer E's recording\footnote{The effect of this method is less obvious for performer with better piano skill, because they have better control over tempo stability.}, using the two types of fixed normalization method and the automatic normalization method mentioned in Section \ref{sec:normalize}. The extracted onset deviations are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:norm1}, Fig. \ref{fig:norm3} and Fig.\ref{fig:normauto}. Each dotted line from left to right represents a phrase in the corpus. Each dot represents the onset deviation value of a note. The notes are spread uniformly  on the horizontal axis, which only shows the order of appearance, not the real time scale. First, we can see in Fig. \ref{fig:norm3} that aligning the note-off of the last notes results in very large deviation in some phrases. This is because performers tend to extend the last note in certain phrases to emphasize the end of a phrase or section. This kind of extension will cause the last notes onset in the performance far apart from the score. Fig. \ref{fig:normauto} and Fig. \ref{fig:norm1} looks much similar, but the onset deviation values in Fig. \ref{fig:norm1} is more dramatic than those in Fig. \ref{fig:normauto}, which proofs that the automatic normalization method can indeed reduce the overall onset deviation. Another benefit of the automatic normalization over aligning last notes onsets is that the last note onset is not force aligned, which allows more space for free expression for the last note. This effect can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:norm1}, in which the right-most end of a line, i.e. the last note, always goes back to zero, while in Fig. \ref{fig:normauto}, the end of a line can end in a wide range of values.

\section{Parameter Selection}
\label{sec:paramselect}
\subsection{SVM-HMM-related Parameters}
Since SVM-HMM is a combination of SVM and HMM, there are many parameters which need adjustment from both model. Two parameters are tested in this experiment to find the optimal value: the termination accuracy $\varepsilon$ and the misclassification penalty factor C in SVM. SVM-HMM is an iterative algorithm, the $\varepsilon$ parameter defines the required accuracy for the algorithm to terminate. A smaller $\varepsilon$ will result in higher accuracy, but may need to run more iterations. The C parameter determines how hard non-separable samples should be penalised. A large C will sacrifice larger margin for lower misclassification error, but it will make the execution longer.%Therefore, we will leave the rest of the parameters to their default value, and try to find the best C parameter.l

We use the whole set of Clementi's Sonatinas Op.36 from performer A, split them into two sets: the training set includes pieces No. 2 to No. 6, and the testing set includes piece No. 1. We train a model with the training set, and use the learned model to generate the testing set. The generated expressive performance is compared to the original recordings to see verify the accuracy of the prediction.


%Structural Support Vector Machine has some parameters that needed to be adjusted. We will leave the others to the defaults and change the SVM C trad-off parameter in this experiment. Since three models are learned for three performance features, we have three parameters to adjust. 
%TODO default parameters

%[TODO: phrases count] phrases from [TODO:song counts] songs are used for training. Every first, fifth, and tenth phrases from each song is not included in the training sample, but used as testing samples. A three-by-three grid is layed out for three C parameters, each C takes the value of the powers of tenfrom [TODO: Cs] $10^{-5}$ to $10^4$, so [TODO: num of experiment] paramenters are tested. Then the result is validated
%To measure the effectiveness of the $\varepsilon$ and C parameters, the generated performance is compared to the performance recorded by the performer. 
Ideally, the generated performance will be very similar (in expression) to the recording. So, for every pair of the generated and recorded performances, we calculate the distance (defined below) of the performance features, and take the median value of all the distances for every C. Note that each performance feature has its own model, so we will be looking at a performance feature and its C parameter one at a time.  
First, the generated performance features sequence and the recorded one are normalized to a range from 0 to 1. The normalization is required because we want to tolerate linear scaling. Then the Euclidean distance of the two normalized sequence is calculated and divided by the length (in notes) of the phrase, since the phrase can have arbitrary length.


First we fixed C at 0.1 and tried different $\varepsilon$'s: 100, 10, 1, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.1. Then, we fix $\varepsilon$ at the optimal value determined in the previous step and test 's: $10^{-3}, 10^{-2}, 10^{-1}, 0.5, 1, 5$. For each $\varepsilon$ and C combination, we calculate the distance between the generated pieces and recorded examples for all phrases in the testing set for each performer. Then we take the median of all these distances for each $\varepsilon$ or C. The optimal $\varepsilon$ or C is the one which can minimize the median of the distance.


%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Are all the output samples successfully generated? (Generation may fail if the performance features are unreasonable, for example, negative onset timeing.)
%	\item Is the order of the notes preserved? Sometimes the first note is delayed too long and the second note is played too early, so the order is swaped.
%	\item Are there any extreme parameters that makes the expressive performance unnatural?
%\end{enumerate}

%The first two criterias are checked by python scripts, the last one is done by manual inspection.

\framebox{TODO: median}
The median distance of the generated performance from the recording for various $\varepsilon$'s are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:eps_accu}. The execution time for various $\varepsilon$'s are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:eps_time}. For $\varepsilon$ value 100 and 10, the termination criteria is too generous so the learning algorithm terminates almost immediately without any real calculation. Therefore, the model didn't learns anything, the outputs are fixed values for any input. So we abandon the data points for $\varepsilon = 100 or 10$. We can see that the distance drops slowly when $\varepsilon$ becomes smaller. We choose $\varepsilon = 0.1$ for later experiments. %But after $\varepsilon$ is smaller than 0.5, the accuracy doesn't drop anymore. So we will choose $\varepsilon = 0.5 $ for the rest of the experiment to avoid unnecessary computations.

\end{figure*}

As for different C parameter, the accuracy and execution time are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:c_accu} and Fig. \ref{fig:c_time} respectively. We can not find a clear trend in Fig. \ref{fig:c_accu}, but just as $\varepsilon$, some C failed to produce meaningful model, so the data points are omitted. In Fig. \ref{fig:c_time} the execution time grows as C goes larger, so considereing the robustness (always producing meaningful model) and time tradeoff, we choose C = 0.1 as our optimal C.

\end{figure*}
\subsection{Quantization Parameter}
Besides $\varepsilon$ and C, the number of quantization levels for SVM-HMM input is also has some impact on the execution time. If the performance features are quantized into more fine-grained levels, the quantization errors can be reduced, but the execution time and memory usage will grow dramatically. Also, larger number of intervals doesn't imply more accurate or robust model. Because SVM-HMM is originally used in part-of-speech tagging problem, if we use divide the performance features into more intervals, there will be fewer samples in each interval. But from a statistical learning point of view, it is desirable to have fewer bins with more samples in each, rather than a large number of bins with very sparse samples. For example, if a three note segment is played once in the following MIDI velocity: (60, 70, 80), and the same phrase is played again in (60.1, 69.9, 80.1). If we have a quantization interval width of, say, 0.05, then 60 and 60.1 may be quantized into different bins, and 70 and 69.9 may also be quantized to different bins, so the two phrases will be considered as two different case. However, if the quantization interval width is 1, both phrases may be the same after quantization, which is more desirable because the SVM-HMM algorithm can capture the similarity in the two samples. 

Initially, we tried to quantized the values into 1025 uniform width bins, wishing to minimize quantization error. But it take very long (hours, even days) to learn a model, and the output only falls on a very sparse set of values. So we reduce the number to 128. Taking a rough estimate, onset deviation feature rarely exceeds $\pm 1$, so the quantization interval is around $\frac{1-(-1)}{128} = 0.015625$. Most duration ratios falls between zero and three, so the interval is $\frac{3-0}{128} = 0.0234375$. MIDI velocity is roughly around 30 to 90, so the interval is about $\frac{90-30}{128} = 0.46875$. This level of granularity is good enough for our performance system, and can dramatically reduce the execution time without sacrificing the expressiveness of the models. 

We repeat the $\varepsilon$ selection experiment in the previous section for quantization level of 1025 and 128. The execution time (in CPU second) is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:quant_comp}. The time required for 1025 is larger than 128 by orders of magnitudes. The expressiveness of the output is even improved (evaluated by subjective listening).

\section{Human-like Performance}
\label{sec:turing}
The goal of our system is to create expressive, non-robotic music as oppose to deadpan MIDI. Therefore, we would like to perform a Turing-test-style survey to find out how people think about the our generated expressive music.

In this survey, 1518 computer generated expressive phrases and their corresponding human recording are used as candidates. Each test subject was given 10 randomly selected computer generated phrase and 10 random human recordings, these 20 phrases are presented in random order. He/She was asked to rate each phrase according to the following criteria, which were proposed by RenCon contest\cite{rencon}:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Technical control – if a performance sounds like it is technically skilled thus performed with accurate and secure notes, rhythms, tempo and articulation.
   \item  Humanness – if the performance sounds like a human was playing it.
   \item  Musicality – how musical the performance is in terms of tone and color, phrasing, flow, mood and emotions
   \item Expressive variation – how much expressive variation (versus deadpan) there is in the performance.
\end{enumerate}

In RenCon, each judge was asked to give separate ratings for each criteria. But we believe that this will be too demanding for less-experienced participant, so we asked test subjects to vote an single overall rating from one to five. One being very bad, five being very good. The test subjects are also asked to report their musical proficiency in a three level scale:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item No experience in music 
   \item Amateur performer
   \item Professional musician, musicologist or student majored in music
\end{enumerate}

To generate the expressive performance phrase. We follow a six-fold cross validation pattern: for each performer in the corpus, we use all his/her recorded phrases of Clementi's Op.36 No. 2 to No. 6 to train a model. Then the model is used to generate all phrases from Clementi's Op.36 No. 1. The generate phrases and the performer's recordings of piece No. 1 will all be included to be rated. The process is repeated, but each time the piece excluded for training will be changed to No. 2, No. 3 and so on. So all six pieces will have a computer generated version and recorded version for each player's corpus.

%With these music material ready, we built a survey web page to let the test subjects vote. A test subject was first asked to report their music proficiency (No music training at all, amateur or professional musician/scholar/student) and musical instrument skill. Then he/she will be asked to identify the computer generated phrase from a generated/recorded pair. Five pairs will be randomly selected from all the available pairs, and the order of appearance of the generated and recorded one will be randomized.

We have also tried using all performer's recording to train a single models. However, the expressive variation from the model is much smaller than a single performer's model. This is because expression from different performer may cancel each other out. The distribution histogram for each performance features are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:distonset}, \ref{fig:distdur} and \ref{fig:distvel}. The features generated from the full corpus are slightly more concentrated, which results in less dramatic expression.

\framebox{TODO:Turing test result and discussion}

%We distributed a web survey to check if our computer generated performance are indistinguishable to human recordings.  The expressive performance generated by the method described above are collected, as well as all human recordings from the corpus. Each participant will be given ten random phrases from the computer generated phrases, and ten random phrases from human recordings. The twenty phrases will be presented in random order. The participant are asked to give 

We received 119 valid samples for the survey. Fifty of them are from people with no music background, 59 are from amateur musicians, and the rest 10 are from professional musicians. The average rating given to computer generated performance and human recordings are listed in Table \ref{tab:avg_rating}. It is clear that for professional and amateur musician, the average rating given to human performances are higher than computer performances. However, for participants who have no experience in music, the rating is much closer. A Student T-test on the two ratings for participants with no experience yields a p-value of 0.0312, therefore we can't reject the null hypothesis that the two ratings are different under a significance level of 99\%.

\begin{table}
   \centering

   \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In order to get more insight from the ratings, we can further divide the performers in the corpus in to two categories based on their piano skill. By the number of mistakes made (Table \ref{tab:mistakes}), performer A and B are considered more skillful than performer C, D, E and F. The average rating given to the two categories are listed in Table \ref{tab:good-bad_rating}. The distance between computer and human performances are smaller for less-skillful group (C to F) than the skillful group (A and B). This is probably because our system makes some mistakes that are similar to the mistakes made by less-skilled performers. For example, unsteady tempo, sudden change in loudness, hesitation and emphasising notes that are structurally less important are all common problems that exists in both less-skilled performance and computer generated performance. But for skillful performer, who have better technical control and sense of musical structure, the problems described above will happen less often. %This is probably because our system still can't capture every nuance of human performances.

\end{table}

If we look into each individual participant, we can check if a participant gives higher (average) rating to computer or human performances, or equal ratings for both. The number of participants who fall into each categories are shown in Table \ref{tab:avg_count}. Twenty-six of the non-experienced participants give higher or equal rating to computer than human, slightly higher than twenty-four people who gives higher rating to human. For amateur and professional musicians, the number of people who prefers human are much higher. Table \ref{tab:good-bad_count} is a table similar to \ref{tab:avg_count}, but split into two categories just like Table \ref{tab:good-bad_rating}. The results are similar to Table \ref{tab:avg_count}: the difference between computer and human is higher for skilled performers (A and B) than less-skilled performers (C to F).
