There are many room for improvements. Structural expressions such as phrasing, contract between sections, or even contrast between movements can be added. Other information like text notations, harmonic analysis and musicological analysis can be added. Supporting homophonic or polyphonic music is also important for the system to be useful. Sub-note expressions like physical model synthesizer or envelope shaping can also be applied to generate performance system for specific musical instruments. \framebox{Error model?} It's also crucial to test the system on more samples from different genre or music style, to verify the effectiveness of different systems. We also believe combining rule-based model and machine learning model may be a possible direction for computer expressive music performance research, because machine learning methods can learn subconscious expressions, while rule based system can enable the user to control the overall expression of a piece of music with ease.
